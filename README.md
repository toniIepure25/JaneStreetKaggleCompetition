## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the `responder_6` field—a proxy for trading decisions—using a high-dimensional, non-stationary financial dataset. Our approach combines cutting-edge feature engineering and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, including an ensemble of XGBoost models and a supervised autoencoder framework, to extract meaningful signals from noisy market data.

---

## Dataset Challenges

- **Fat-Tailed Distributions & Noise:** The dataset exhibits heavy tails and significant noise, posing a challenge for traditional modeling techniques.
- **Temporal Dependencies:** The data includes strong time-based dependencies and correlations among features.
- **Complex Relationships:** Lagged responder fields and engineered features interact in nonlinear ways, necessitating advanced modeling strategies.

---

## Approach

### Data Understanding and Preprocessing

- **Exploratory Analysis:** Thoroughly analyzed dataset structure to identify key patterns and anomalies.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data consistency.
- **Feature Selection:** Excluded metadata (e.g., `row_id`, `date_id`, `time_id`) to focus on the most predictive signals.

### Feature Engineering

A comprehensive feature engineering pipeline was developed to extract and enhance predictive signals:

- **Lagged Features:**  
  - Created lagged versions of raw features and responders (`responder_0` to `responder_8`) over multiple horizons (1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21 time steps).
  
- **Rolling Statistics:**  
  - Computed rolling means and standard deviations over a 7-day window to capture short-term trends.
  
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**  
  - Introduced EMA features with spans of 7, 14, and 21 days to capture momentum-based signals.
  
- **Technical Indicators:**  
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Added to gauge overbought/oversold conditions.
  - **MACD and Bollinger Bands:** Integrated for trend-following and volatility signals.
  
- **Rank Transformations:**  
  - Normalized features through rank transformations to improve model robustness.
  
- **Feature Interactions:**  
  - Engineered interaction terms (e.g., products and ratios) between key features to model nonlinear dependencies.
  
- **Supervised Autoencoders:**  
  - Trained autoencoders to learn compact representations of the high-dimensional feature space, preserving critical signals while reducing noise.

### Model Development

- **Baseline Model:**  
  - A simple XGBoost regressor trained on lagged features and rolling statistics achieved a baseline R² score of **0.680**.
  
- **Advanced Model:**  
  - Integrated the full feature set (including autoencoder-transformed features) into a tuned XGBoost model.
  - Applied hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian search to further refine performance.
  
- **Ensemble Strategy:**  
  - Combined predictions from multiple XGBoost models trained on different feature subsets to enhance generalizability.

### Evaluation and Iteration

- **Validation Techniques:**  
  - Utilized out-of-fold predictions and time-based splits to ensure robust model validation.
  
- **Model Refinement:**  
  - Reduced overfitting by strategically excluding responder-based features in later iterations while retaining key engineered signals.

## Results

| **Version**   | **Approach**                                       | **Validation R²** |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Baseline      | Lagged features and rolling statistics             | 0.680             |
| Intermediate  | Added EMA, RSI, and interaction terms              | 0.890             |
| **Final**     | Full feature set + supervised autoencoder          | **0.978**         |

The final model consistently demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy, effectively capturing complex temporal and cross-feature dependencies.

## Key Insights

- **Responder Fields:**  
  Early iterations benefited from using lagged responder fields; however, to mitigate overfitting, later versions focused on raw features and engineered statistics.
  
- **Supervised Autoencoders:**  
  These played a critical role in learning noise-resistant, compact representations of the data, thereby enhancing model robustness.
  
- **Importance of Statistical Features:**  
  Rolling statistics, EMA, and technical indicators like Bollinger Bands were pivotal in capturing nuanced market behavior.
